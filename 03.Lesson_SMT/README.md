 # SMT - Satisfiability Modulo Theories

</br>

The Certora Prover uses SMT solvers as its core technology. The role of the SMT is to decide whether a property, expressed as a set of logic expressions, can be proved or disproved.

It comes in handy to have a general notion of how the Certora Prover handles our high-level queries under the hood. By learning how the engine works, we can better understand the results and errors that may arise, the limitations of the technology (at least currently), and some additional difficulties that we might encounter in the future. 


- [x] Read the intro of the wiki entry [Satisfiability Modulo Theories
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories) to get a sense of what is an SMT solver. You can read further, but bear in mind that it's advanced material.

</br>

- [x] Follow the [Z3SMTSolver](Z3SMTSolver) instructions.

</br>

- [x] Watch a lecture by Prof. Mooly Sagiv, founder of Certora, on satisfiability problem (SAT) and the underlying mechanism of SMT solvers - [Link](https://youtu.be/9kKA4uBRqVo).
