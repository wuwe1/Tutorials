### variable transition
- prize decrease only
- bid expiry increase only

### high-level
- payment is invariant
- total supply >= the sum of balances of all users
- token supply should be bounded


### unit test
- mint should increase balances[who] by amount
- transferTo should increase balances[to] by _value and decrease balances[msg.sender] by _value
